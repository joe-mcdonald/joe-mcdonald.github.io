During my final co-op term during the summer of 2024, I worked at an organization called CanAssist at the University of Victoria. They create specialized technology for people living with disabilities. I was hired to redevelop an existing app of theirs, CanPlan, from the ground up using the Dart framework Flutter as the existing app was outdated. The app allows users to create tasks with custom audio, images, videos and descriptions, schedule and categorize tasks, and notify users when they have a scheduled task. It is designed to help people with cognitive disabilities complete tasks successfully. The app is designed for various device sized on both iOS and Android, and it features a robust database that migrates existing user data from the old app to the new app.

Most of this work was independant and I collaborated with an external contractor. This was by far the largest responsibility I've ever been given on a co-op job, and I am very proud of what I accomplished.
