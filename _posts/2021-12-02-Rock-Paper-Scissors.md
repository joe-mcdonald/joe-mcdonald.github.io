This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that I made in Python. It features user
input and you get to play against the computer. A nice thing about playing
against the computer is that you will never have the same choice, so the
game won't go on forever. You also have the choice of playing again without
having to restart the program. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/joe-mcdonald/rockpaperscissors){:target="Blank"}

Enjoy!
