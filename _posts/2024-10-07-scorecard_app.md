During the summer of 2024, I build a golf scorecard app using the app development framework Flutter. I wanted an app that could reliably keep track of score throughout a round of golf, calculate scores, and perform match play calculations. Currently, the app is on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/scorecard-app/id6504263909), and I have support for numerous courses in Vancouver, Victoria and Whistler.
